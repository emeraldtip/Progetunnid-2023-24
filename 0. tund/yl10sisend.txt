Fragmentation is a multistage process. 
(A) High-speed images show first fracture (Movie S1). 
A crack nucleates and grows initially on a relatively slow millisecond timescale. 
Catastrophic failure occurs at a critical crack depth (the Griffith length) leading to rapid crack propagation within ∼10 µs. 
Subsequent separation of the two fragments is governed by another slower timescale associated with bending waves. 
(B) High-speed images show sequential fractures separated by a characteristic distance. 
Fragments are ejected with considerable angular velocity, in agreement with the observation of nonsimultaneous fractures. 
(C) Simulations show bending waves originating at the point of first fracture creating additional fractures separated by at least the minimum fragment length λ. 
The predicted fracture times agree with B. In simulations, fragments are frozen after fracture and do not evolve further. 
(D) The time between the first two fractures and the resulting fragment length lie along the space-time path of the location of maximum bending stress (solid line) (sample size n = 110). 
The distance between the first two fractures depends on quench speed but is bounded from below. 
Diameter of rod and gaps between fragments are enhanced for visualization in C.
